# Gemini CLI Task Log

This file will be updated after every task to keep a record of completed actions and ongoing work.

## Identified Incomplete Tasks:

- **Supabase Quiz Schema Refactoring**: The database schema for quizzes has been refactored (`quizzes` table renamed to `quiz_questions`, and a new `quizzes` table created for metadata). **The application code needs to be updated to reflect these changes, which is a significant pending task.**

    - Created a new `getQuizzes` function to fetch quiz metadata.
    - Renamed `createQuiz` to `createQuizQuestion`.
